// Define the radius of the circle
const radius = 5;

// Calculate the area of the circle
const area = Math.PI * radius ** 2;

// Calculate the circumference of the circle
const circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;

// Log the results to the console
console.log(`The area of the circle is: ${area}`);
console.log(`The circumference of the circle is: ${circumference}`);


This code uses the built-in Math object in JavaScript to calculate the area and circumference of a circle. The Math.PI property gives us the value of pi, and the ** operator is used to raise the radius to the power of 2. The console.log statements at the end print out the results of the calculations.

You could also encapsulate this functionality in a function, like so:


function calculateCircle(radius) {
  const area = Math.PI * radius ** 2;
  const circumference = 2 * Math.PI * radius;
  return { area, circumference };
}

const radius = 5;
const { area, circumference } = calculateCircle(radius);

console.log(`The area of the circle is: ${area}`);
console.log(`The circumference of the circle is: ${circumference}`);


In this version, the calculateCircle function takes a radius parameter and returns an object with the area and circumference properties. The function can then be called with a specific radius value, and the returned object can be destructured to get the area and circumference values, which are then logged to the console.
